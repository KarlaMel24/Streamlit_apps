This repository is for Streamlit applications that I have developed during my Bioinformatics journey.
In the 'requirements.txt', you will find the requirements to run all the apps.

'ESMFold' is a protein structure predictor that has a limit of 400 amino acids (aa). It also provides the pIDDT score and a brief protein analysis.
- pIDDT score: A confidence score in the prediction.
- Protein analysis: Includes molecular weight, isoelectric point (the pH at which the protein's net charge is zero), and secondary structure fraction (the proportion of alpha-helices, beta-sheets, and turns, respectively)
